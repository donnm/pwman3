== ikegam's function ==

 * making a password from the numeric character and the alphabet character ([A-Za-z0-9]).

   You can add a parametor for making the password to the config(~/.pwman/config).

   For Example)
     [Generator]
     numerics = true
     
 * Passwords can be l33tified similarly using the following.
     [Generator]
     leetify = true
 
 * Copying password to X11 clipbord:
     Specify the path to `xsel` if you already have `~/.pwman/config` 
      [Global]
      xsel = yes
      xselpath = /usr/bin/xsel
     
     When launching `pwman` for the first time, it will try and look for 
     `xsel` and write the configuration properly.
